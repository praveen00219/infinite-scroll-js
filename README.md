# Infinite Scrolling Image Gallery

This project is a simple web application that implements an infinite scrolling image gallery. The gallery fetches images from an API and loads more images as the user scrolls down the page.

## Features

- **Image Fetching:** Images are fetched from the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) API, a free service providing random images.
- **Responsive Design:** The gallery layout adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the image gallery.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing the infinite scroll functionality and API integration.
- **Lorem Picsum API**: For fetching random images.
